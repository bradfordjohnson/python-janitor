# python-janitor

This is my personal Python module that I built for cleaning up dirty data. I was inspired by the `janitor` package in R, and I wanted to build something similar in Python. While there are already some existing janitor-inspired packages in Python, I wanted to build my own version that is tailored to my needs.
